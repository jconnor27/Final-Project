# About 
(Updated: 5/11/23)

The information problem I am hoping to examine pertains to instructors, and their capabilities
of teaching different classes. Do you want to see all the classes your favorite professor is or 
has taught? Do you want to see which department is the most diverse in terms of being able to 
teach other subjects? Are any departments highly specialized in a specific area? By pulling from 
the UMD.io API, these sorts of questions may soon have an answer.

Users could either type in the professor's name or select certain departments to see a list of the
classes offered by the search parameter.
• Users could also search by course to see which departments or instructors are teaching it.
• For visualizations:
o When searching by course:
▪ Returns a graph comparing how many instructors from each department teach
the course.
• Can click on a portion to see the list of professors.
o When searching by department or professor:
▪ Returns a graph comparing the number of the types of courses taught.
• Can click on a portion to see the list of courses.
